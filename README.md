# TabCompleted
A modern re-imagination of the Minecraft player list using modern tools such as MiniMessage and Kyori Adventure

## Reasoning:
TABReborn is getting kind of old isn't it?
Lacking some features that would be ideal for large Minecraft networks.
I originally came to a roadblock involving a nickname plugin that I was writing broke horribly when using TAB,
not a big problem on the surface but it is what eventually lead me to the path of writing my own plugin with more modern features and best of all, cross server support without the need of a proxy.

## Notes:
- This project is still heavily in-dev and will not have an official release for a decent amount of time, bear with me.

## Credits:
- [PacketEvents](https://github.com/retrooper/packetevents) - Amazing library used for all packet related things, this project wouldn't exist without it!
- [DazzleConf](https://github.com/dejvokep/boosted-yaml) - Awesome library that makes config management w/ serialization super simple.
- [TAB](https://github.com/NEZNAMY/TAB) - Being the go-to solution for many years and a reference for features that have been and will be added to this project.
